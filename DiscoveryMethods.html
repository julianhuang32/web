<ul>
		<li> Transit Method- scientists xan find exoplanets by noticing dips in light when a planet crosses its star</li>
		<li> Transit Timing- Scientists can find additional exoplanets in a given system by timing transit variations compared to predicted variations if they assume the star has one planet </li>
		<li> Pulsar Timing  - scientsists can find exoplanets around pulsars by measuring variation in pulsar pulses, which are usually very accurate but can vary if its moving back in forth (due to another object nearby) </li>
		<li> Radial Velocity - scientists can find exoplanets around stars by measuring the changes in a stars velocity due to a planet tugging on it</li>
</ul>
