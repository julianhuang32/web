		<li> Transit Method- scientists can find exoplanets by noticing dips in light when a planet crosses its star. This makes up the bulk of exoplanet discoveries. However, there are a few downsides, as if the orbital plane of the exoplanet is not aligned with the viewers field of view, scientists cannot see planets cross the star.</li>
		<li> Transit Timing- Scientists can find additional exoplanets in a given system by timing transit variations compared to predicted variations if they assume the star has one planet </li>
		<li> Pulsar Timing  - scientsists can find exoplanets around pulsars by measuring variation in pulsar pulses. Pulsars are usually accurate and punctual, any variation (ruling out variation due to relative motion to Earth) must mean the pulsar is being tugged by an orbiting object, periodically shifting its distance and causing a variation in pulses. </li>
		<li> Radial Velocity - scientists can find exoplanets around stars by measuring the changes in a stars velocity due to a planet tugging on it. This can work regardless of orbital planes, but it tends to find more massive planets as small terrestrial worlds have very minute effects on a star's velocity.</li>
