		<h3> Host Stars and Habitability </h3>
			<li><a href="https://www.space.com/22437-main-sequence-stars.html"> information on star life cycles. Important to note that the difference between main sequence and other stages</a></li>
			<p> Main Sequence Stars increasing mass/temp from left to right- M → K → G → F → A → B → O
                        G type stars like the sun are a medium ground between solar activity, size, mass and temperature.
			M types at first seem very habitable given their long lifespan, but their cooler temperatures and huge solar flares often make them less desirable
				<li>Eyeball planets are the result of close proximity to their stars, their tidal locking means one side is constantly heated by the sun, while the other is not, leading to less hospitable conditions </li>
				<li>M type stars have a tendency to have strong Solar flares which can strip a planets atmosphere without proper protection</li>
			K type stars seem to be the most habitable, they last decently long and they have decently low stellar activity.
			Very massive stars (such as wolf-rayet) tend to be a little violent as they tend to shed mass, flinging hydrogen and helium all over the system, and dont last long (and end violently) giving little opportunity for life to evolve

		<h3> Mass/Density </h3>
			
			<p> Mass and Density, while both challenging to calculate, are important because they determine composition 
				<li> Earth-like density and mass generally hints towards an iron core, and similar mineral composition </li>
				<li> Large mass and low density usually is synonymous to Jupiter/Neptune like objects </li>
				<li> Earth-like mass but a noticeably lower density usually means a larger presence of water. </li>

		<h3> Atmosphere/temperature </h3>

			<p> Atmospheric requirements are more loose, as the definition of habitability does not necessarily mean habitable for humans. Life is robust and can survive in a variety of conditions. 
			However, for the sake of this presentation, we will not consider the capabilities of extremophiles or exotic life (silicon based, whatever it may be), but rather consider the baselines for more complex organisms like us humans
			There needs to be an atmosphere in the first place. If there is an atmosphere, the pressure and contents need to be safe and viable. A proper amount of oxygen and low amounts of H2S and SO2 (which are very toxic) is good, alongside a small but present amount of greenhouse gases. Also there needs to be proper pressure, anywhere from 50-~100 bar should be good. Temperature-wise, humans are pretty adaptable especially given proper technology. Humans have been able to survive in a myriad of climates.

		<h3> Stability of Host systems </h3>
			
			<p> Host systems must be stable in order for planets (No matter how habitable) to propagate life. Here, Orbital resonance is important- which is the ratio of two orbital periods of two objects in orbit around a star or planet.
			While generally most objects fall into resonance after a period of time (or are destroyed/kicked out), some resonances are more stable than others due to their tendencies to self correct if one of the objects begins to fall out of resonance
			These include the resonance 1:2:4 (galilean moons) and the Pluto/Neptune resonance of 2:3
