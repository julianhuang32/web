		<li> Above is Trappist-1, one of the most famous exoplanet systems discovered in recent times. It contains 7 earth-like planets, 3 of which are presumed to be habitable to human life. </li>
		<p> An exoplanet is any planet outside of the solar system. This excludes rouge planets, which do not orbit around any star. 
		The first exoplanet was confirmed in 1992, when scientists discovered two planets orbiting around a pulsar. These are often overshadowed by the discovery of 51 Pegasi b (1995), the first exoplanet discovered around a “normal” star.
