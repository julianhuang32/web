		<li> Planets that orbit other stars are called exoplanets- and they remain one of the most exciting and promising sections of astronomy today.
For generations, Humanity looked to the stars wondering what they were like. Many theorized the existence of worlds beyond our own solar system, but there was nothing to prove their existence. It wasn’t until the 1990’s when scientists discovered it was indeed fact that other stars could have planets of their own. Soon, discoveries of exoplanets began rolling in… they were actually pretty common, at least in the Milky Way.
When exoplanets stopped being a rarity, astronomers began to wonder: is there another earth out there? These questions sparked an unparalleled exploration of the universe- telescopes like Hubble and Kepler peered into the deep cosmos, looking at distant stars.
Based on findings, there probably is. Our studies with exoplanets have enabled us to infer that. First, Water IS common in the universe. From the subsurface oceans of Enceladus to Europa, water seems to be everywhere in the solar system, and most likely common in other places too. Secondly, several things must be in place in order for a world to be habitable, not just distance from a star.
Third, compared to other types of planets- An earth like planet is not very common. However, exoplanets are so common that even with the small percentage, there are most likely thousands and millions of Earth-Like planets in the milky way alone. We just need to find them.

Kepler alone discovered thousands of planets in under half a decade… just by looking at a few select patches of the infinite space. So far, astronomers have discovered more than 50 possible Earth-Like Exoplanets. With the TESS now in Orbit, who knows what we will find next?
